Our models contain three approximations to plane-wave density functional theory (DFT): (i) we use a small basis set, (ii) we approximate self-consistency, and (iii) we approximate many-center exchange and correlation effects. We test a range of approximations for many-center exchange-correlation and self-consistency to gauge the accuracy of each in isolation. This systematic approach also allows us to combine multiple approximations in the optimal manner for our final tight-binding models. Furthermore, the breakdown of errors into those from individual approximations is expected to be a useful guide for which approximations to include in other tight-binding models. We attempt to correct any remaining errors in our models by fitting a pair potential. Our final tight-binding model for Mg shows excellent agreement with plane-wave results for a wide range of properties (e.g., errors below 10% for self-interstitial formation energies and below 3% for equilibrium volumes) and is expected to be highly transferable due to the minimal amount of fitting. Calculations with our Zr model also show good agreement with plane-wave results (e.g., errors below 2% for equilibrium volumes) except for properties where self-consistency is important, such as self-interstitial formation energies. However, for these properties we are able to generate a tight-binding model which shows excellent agreement with non-self-consistent DFT with a small basis set (i.e., many-center effects are captured accurately by our approximations). As we understand the source of remaining errors in our Zr model we are able to outline the methods required to build upon it to describe the remaining properties with greater accuracy.","tags":[],"title":"TightBinding-II","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"The group at King\u0026rsquo;s College (Sebastian Budd, Alexander Lozovoi and Tony Paxton) have been using tight-binding to model the Grotthuss proton transfer mechanism in water.

The errors introduced at each level of approximation are discussed and quantified. For bulk materials, using a limited basis set of *spd* orbitals is shown to be sufficient to reproduce with high accuracy bulk energy versus volume curves for fcc, bcc, and hcp lattice structures, as well as the electronic density of states. However, the two-center approximation introduces errors of several tenths of eV in the pair potential, crystal-field terms, and hopping integrals. Environmentally dependent corrections to the former two have been implemented, significantly improving the accuracy. Two-center hopping integrals were corrected by taking many-center hopping integrals for a set of structures of interest, rotating them into the bond reference frame, and then fitting a smooth function through these values. Finally, a pair potential was fitted to correct remaining errors. However, this procedure is not sufficient to ensure transferability of the model, especially when point defects are introduced. In particular, it is shown to be problematic when interstitial elements are added to the model, as demonstrated in the case of octahedral self-interstitial atoms.","tags":[],"title":"TightBinding-I","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"Notes written by Tony Paxton as part of a series of journal clubs at Kings College London and Imperial College London in 2018.\nElectrophysics-Notes.pdf\n","date":1564143167,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564143167,"objectID":"a5463119f63de8eccfb7a3cd3b107bfb","permalink":"/post/tony-electrophysics-notes/tony-electrophysics-notes/","publishdate":"2019-07-26T13:12:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/tony-electrophysics-notes/tony-electrophysics-notes/","section":"post","summary":"Notes written by Tony Paxton as part of a series of journal clubs at Kings College London and Imperial College London in 2018.","tags":["corrosion","electrochemistry"],"title":"Electrophysics Notes","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We are happy to announce that we are having a one-day corrosion meeting at Imperial College (London) on Thursday 25 April 2019.

For example $M^{++}+e^{-}\\to M^{+}$ is reduction because the oxidation state of M(II) is reduced to M(I). Similarly $M\\to M^{+}+e^{-}$ is oxidation: this happens at the anode during corrosion.\n A noble metal is unreactive and has a large positive standard electrode potential. The solid metal is more stable than its aqueous ions.\n A base metal is reactive and has large negative standard electrode potential. The solid metal is less stable than its aqueous ions.\n An ideally polarizable electrode supports the applied potential without allowing any current to flow. It can be thought of as acting like a capacitor.\n An ideally non-polarizable electrode supports a current from the electode into the solution with very small applied potentials.\n  Structure  There are several models of the electrical double layer\n The Helmholtz double layer has a fixed layer of ions\n The Gouy \u0026amp; Chapman double layer has point ions that follow Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The Posson-Boltzmann equation can be linearized in the low concentration limit to solve Poisson’s equation.\n The Stern double layer combines a fixed layer with a diffuse region.\n The Grahame double layer has an Inner Helmholtz Plane (absorbed), an Outer Helmholtz Plane, and a diffuse layer.\n   Equilibrium Thermodynamics Corrosion can be described by a series of chemical reactions.\nStandard results from chemistry.  At equilibrium the ratios of the amounts of reactants and products can be computed. For a reaction of the form\n $$n_{1}R_{1}+n_{2}R_{2}+\\dots+n_{N}R_{N}\\rightleftharpoons m_{1}P_{1}+m_{2}P_{2}+\\dots+m_{M}P_{M}\\label{eq:N1}$$  we have equilibrium constant $K$ given by\n $$K=\\frac{\\Pi_{j=1}^{M}\\left\\{ P_{j}\\right\\} ^{m_{j}}}{\\Pi_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{ R_{i}\\right\\} ^{n_{i}}}\\label{eq:N2}$$  where $\\left\\{ X\\right\\}$ is the activity of $X$, and is equal to 1 under standard conditions ($\\left\\{ X\\right\\} ^{\\ominus}=1$).\n Thermodynamic activity is dimensionless and related to concentration by\n$$ \\left{ X\\right} =\\gamma_{X}\\frac{\\left[X\\right]}{\\left[X\\right]^{\\ominus}} \\label{eq:N3}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{X}$ is the activity coefficient. It can also be expressed in a similar manner in terms of pressure or mole fraction.\n The equilibrium constant can be related to the free energy change for the reaction.\nThe free energy is stationary at equilibrium, and hence does not change if a small amount of the reactants transform into products or vice versa. Thus we have $0=\\sum_{j=1}^{M}m_{j}\\mu_{Pu_{j}}-\\sum_{i=1}^{N}n_{i}\\mu_{R_{i}}$ where $\\mu_{P_{j}}$ is the chemical potential for species $P_{j}$ etc.\n Chemical potentials of species vary with their environment according to\n$$ \\mu_{X}=\\mu_{X}^{\\ominus}+RT\\ln\\left\\{ X\\right\\} \\label{eq:N4}$$ where $\\mu_{X}^{\\ominus}$ is the chemical potential of $X$ under standard conditions.\n Substituting the expression for chemical potential into the equilibrium condition gives\n$$\\begin{aligned} 0 \u0026 = \u0026 \\sum_{j=1}^{M}m_{j}\\mu_{P_{j}}^{\\ominus}-\\sum_{i=1}^{N}n_{i}\\mu_{R_{i}}^{\\ominus}+RT\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{M}\\ln\\left\\{ P_{j}\\right\\} ^{m_{j}}-\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\ln\\left\\{ R_{i}\\right\\} ^{n_{i}}\\right)\\\\ \u0026 = \u0026 \\Delta G^{\\ominus}+RT\\ln\\frac{\\Pi_{j=1}^{M}\\left\\{ P_{j}\\right\\} ^{m_{j}}}{\\Pi_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{ R_{i}\\right\\} ^{n_{i}}} \\end{aligned}$$ where $\\Delta G^{\\ominus}=\\sum_{j=1}^{M}m_{j}\\mu_{P_{j}}^{\\ominus}-\\sum_{i=1}^{N}n_{i}\\mu_{R_{i}}^{\\ominus}$.\nThis can be rearranged to give\n$$ K=\\frac{\\Pi_{j=1}^{M}\\left\\{ P_{j}\\right\\} ^{m_{j}}}{\\Pi_{i=1}^{N}\\left\\{ R_{i}\\right\\} ^{n_{i}}}=\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ominus}}{RT}\\right) \\label{eq:N5}$$  Nernst Equation The Nernst equation is a statement about equilibrium for half reactions. Consider the reaction $$M^{z+}+ze^{-}\\rightleftharpoons M\\label{eq:N5.1}$$ At equilibrium the change of Gibbs free energy is zero if you go forwards or backwards. Thus we have $$\\mu_{M^{z+}}+z\\mu_{e}-\\mu_{M}=0\\label{eq:N5.2}$$ If we substitute Eq. [eq:N4] into Eq. [eq:N5.2] we get\n $$\\begin{aligned} 0 \u0026 = \u0026 \\mu\\_{M^{z+}}^{\\ominus}+RT\\ln\\left\\{ M^{z+}\\right\\} +z\\left(\\mu\\_{e}^{\\ominus}+\\Delta\\mu\\_{e}\\right)-\\mu\\_{M}^{\\ominus}-RT\\ln\\left\\{ M\\right\\} \\nonumber \\\\ \u0026 = \u0026 \\Delta G^{\\ominus}+RT\\ln\\frac{\\left\\{M^{z+}\\right\\} }{\\left\\{ M\\right\\} }+z\\Delta\\mu\\_{e} \\label{eq:N6} \\end{aligned}$$  where $\\Delta G^{\\ominus}=\\mu_{M^{z+}}^{\\ominus}+z\\mu_{e}^{\\ominus}-\\mu_{M}^{\\ominus}$.\nThe electron chemical potential $\\mu_{e}^{\\ominus}$ is not defined uniquely by the standard conditions. Thus we will add the condition that the system be in equilibrium; this condition can always be met by providing enough $M$ and $M^{z+}$ under standard conditions such that the electron reservoir (electrode) is charged to the point that equilibrium is established. Note that this means that, provided the electrode is metallic and sufficiently inert, it does not matter what material is chosen. Once we reach equilibrium, we have $\\Delta G^{\\ominus}=0$, and hence\n $$\\mu_{e}^{\\ominus}=\\frac{1}{z}\\left(\\mu_{M}^{\\ominus}-\\mu_{M^{z+}}^{\\ominus}\\right)\\label{eq:N7}$$  This corresponds to the standard electrode potential $E^{\\ominus}$ through $\\mu_{e}^{\\ominus}=-FE^{\\ominus}$, where $F$ is a Faraday.\nRearranging Eq. [eq:N6] we then get the Nernst equation\n $$\\begin{aligned} \\mu_{e} \u0026 = \u0026 \\mu_{e}^{\\ominus}-\\frac{RT}{z}\\ln\\frac{\\left\\{ M^{z+}\\right\\} }{\\left\\{ M\\right\\} }\\label{eq:N8}\\\\ E \u0026 = \u0026 E^{\\ominus}-\\frac{RT}{zF}\\ln\\frac{\\left\\{ M\\right\\} }{\\left\\{ M^{z+}\\right\\} }\\label{eq:N8.1}\\end{aligned}$$  The Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) The Standard Hydrogen Electrode is characterized by the equilibrium $H^{+}+e^{-}\\rightleftharpoons\\frac{1}{2}H_{2}$ with pH 0, $P_{H_{2}}=1$ bar, and $T=298$ K. Thus $\\mu_{e}=\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_{2}}-\\mu_{H^{+}}$.\nThe corresponding potential is in the range 4.44 V to 4.85 V relative to vacuum.\nConsider two half reactions\n $$\\begin{aligned} M_{1}^{z_{1}+}+z_{1}e^{-} \u0026 \\rightleftharpoons \u0026 M_{1}\\nonumber \\\\ M^{z_{2}+}+z_{2}e^{-} \u0026 \\rightleftharpoons \u0026 M_{2}\\label{eq:N9}\\end{aligned}$$  with associated standard electrode potentials $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$. Now suppose we allow electrons to flow from the electrode for $M_{1}$ to the electrode for $M_{2}$. The free energy change per mole of electrons is then $\\Delta G=F\\left(E_{1}-E_{2}\\right)$. If $E_{1}\u0026gt;E_{2}$ then $\\Delta G\u0026gt;0$, and it is favourable for the electrons to flow the other way (from 2 to 1). Similarly, if $E_{1}\u0026lt;E_{2}$ it is energetically favourable for the electrons to flow from 1 to 2. In short, electrons flow from the electrode with more negative potential to the one with more positive (as expected). Applying Le Chatelier’s principle, that means coupling two electrodes will cause the reaction with the more negative potential to proceed in the oxidising direction (mnemonic: NO), while the one with the more positive potential will proceed in the reducing direction (mnemonic: PR).\nPourbaix Diagrams These are phase diagrams displaying the most stable species as a function of electrode potential ($\\mu_{e}=-FE$) and pH. The phase boundary lines are derived from the equation of chemical equilibrium. For example, for the equilibrium $Mg^{++}+2H^{+}+4e^{-}\\rightleftharpoons MgH_{2}$ we have $\\mu_{Mg^{++}}+2\\mu_{H^{+}}+4\\mu_{e}=\\mu_{MgH_{2}}$.\nHence,\n $\\mu\\_{e}=\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\mu\\_{MgH\\_{2}}-\\mu\\_{Mg^{++}}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\mu\\_{H^{+}}\\\\ \\approx\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\mu\\_{MgH\\_{2}}-\\mu\\_{Mg^{++}}-2\\mu\\_{H^{+}}^{\\ominus}\\right)+\\frac{2.303}{2}RTpH$.  The voltage is given by $\\mu_{e}=\\mu_{e,ref}-FE$.\nKinetics The Butler-Volmer equation:\n $i=i_{0}\\left\\{ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a}zF\\eta}{RT}\\right)-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{c}zF\\eta}{RT}\\right)\\right\\}$  For large positive (or negative) overpotential we get the Tafel equation\n $$\\begin{aligned} i \u0026 \\approx \u0026 i_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a}zF\\eta}{RT}\\right)\\\\ \\Rightarrow\\ln i \u0026 \\approx \u0026 \\ln i_{0}+\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{a}zF}{RT}\\right)\\eta\\end{aligned}$$  Faraday’s law $$\\frac{m}{M}=\\frac{Q}{nF}$$ where $m$ is the mass of substance produced at an electrode, $Q$ is the total charge delivered to the system, $F$ is Faraday’s constant, $M$ is the molar mass of the substance, and $n$ is the charge per ion.\nAt fixed overpotential, the total measured current must equal the net rate of electron transfer to or from the electrode (to avoid a change in net charge).\nPotentials  Galvani potential $\\phi$ Electric potential inside the conductor Volta potential $\\psi$ Electric potential at point $p$ just outside the interface, in vacuum. Dipole potential $\\chi$ Electric potential difference between the point $p$ and inside: $\\chi=\\phi-\\psi$ Chemical potential $\\mu$ $\\mu=\\mu^{0}+kT\\ln a$ Electrochemical potential $\\tilde{\\mu}$ Work done in taking particle from infinity to the interior of the phase. $\\tilde{\\mu}=\\mu+q\\phi$ Real potential $\\alpha$ Work done in taking particle from inside the phase to point $p$ just outside. $\\alpha=\\tilde{\\mu}-q\\psi=\\mu+q\\chi$. Also $\\alpha=\\alpha^{0}+kT\\ln a$ where $\\alpha^{0}=\\mu^{0}+q\\chi$ Work function $W$ $W=\\tilde{\\mu}^{g,0}-\\tilde{\\mu}^{0}=\\mu^{g,0}-\\alpha^{0}=\\mu^{g,0}-\\mu^{0}-q\\chi$ Potential of Zero Charge The value of the electrode potential such that the electrode surface has zero charge  $q$ is the charge of the particle. Note that the point $p$ is always in vacuum.\nH formation by Mg in aqueous solution Let a piece of pure Mg with a perfectly clean surface be placed in a beaker of pure water. The Mg can dissolve into the water according to\n $$Mg_{(s)}\\rightleftharpoons Mg_{(aq)}^{++}+2e^{-}\\label{eq:RMg}$$  This results in the accumulation of electrons in the solid Mg, lowering its potential (making it more cathodic). The standard electrode potential is -2.38 V. These electrons are free to participate in a second reaction\n $$2H_{2}O+2e^{-}\\rightleftharpoons H_{2}+2OH^{-}\\label{eq:RH}$$  Thus the dissolution of Mg enables the reduction of water to form hydrogen gas. The removal of electrons from the solid Mg by reaction [eq:RH] pulls reaction [eq:RMg] to the right, resulting in further dissolution of g. This in turn produces more electrons, pulling reaction [eq:RH] to the right as well. Thus the two reactions support each other, resulting in the steady formation of hydrogen and dissolution of Mg.\nThe hydroxide ions can combine with Mg ions to form insoluble magnesium hydroxide which has the hexagonal hP3 structure (space group P$\\bar{3}$m1 No. 164, lattice constants a = 0.312 nm, c = 0.473 nm)\n $$Mg_{(aq)}^{++}+2OH_{(aq)}^{-}\\rightleftharpoons Mg(OH)_{2(s)}\\label{eq:RMgOH2}$$  This removes both $Mg^{++}$ and $OH^{-}$ from solution, further encouraging the forward reactions, unless the hydroxide forms a passivating layer.\nWe can quantify the above somewhat by reference to Eq. [eq:N5]we\n $$\\begin{aligned} \\left\\{ Mg_{(aq)}^{++}\\right\\} \u0026 = \u0026 \\frac{K_{Mg}\\left\\{ Mg_{(s)}\\right\\} }{\\left\\{ e^{-}\\right\\} ^{2}}\\label{eq:E1}\\\\ \\left\\{ OH^{-}\\right\\} ^{2} \u0026 = \u0026 \\frac{K_{H}\\left\\{ H_{2}O\\right\\} ^{2}\\left\\{ e^{-}\\right\\} ^{2}}{\\left\\{ H_{2}\\right\\} }\\label{eq:E2}\\\\ \\left\\{ Mg_{(aq)}^{++}\\right\\} \\left\\{ OH^{-}\\right\\} ^{2} \u0026 = \u0026 \\frac{K_{Mg}K_{H}\\left\\{ H_{2}O\\right\\} ^{2}\\left\\{ Mg_{(s)}\\right\\} }{\\left\\{ H_{2}\\right\\} }\\label{eq:E3}\\\\ \u0026 = \u0026 \\frac{\\left\\{ Mg\\left(OH\\right)_{2(s)}\\right\\} }{K_{Mg(OH)_{2}}}\\label{eq:E4}\\end{aligned}$$  From Eq. [eq:N4] we have\n $$\\left\\{ e^{-}\\right\\} =\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{e}-\\mu_{e}^{\\ominus}}{RT}\\right)\\doteq\\exp\\left(\\frac{-FE}{RT}\\right)\\label{eq:mue}$$  Substituting Eq. [eq:mue] into Eqs.

From Eq. [eq:E3] we see that increasing\n $\\left\\{ Mg\\_{(aq)}^{++}\\right\\}$  will decrease  $\\left\\{ OH^{-}\\right\\}$  as the solid hydroxide precipitates out. This in turn will pull reaction [eq:RH] to the right (there will be more $H^{+}$ ions in solution), resulting in more hydrogen production.\n","date":1526300747,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526300747,"objectID":"4d6d0d7dd1851950a5c460115fc630ca","permalink":"/post/2018-corrosion-notes/2018-05-corrosion-notes/","publishdate":"2018-05-14T13:25:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-corrosion-notes/2018-05-corrosion-notes/","section":"post","summary":"As preparation for writing the original grant proposal, Tony Paxton and Andrew Horsfield put together some notes on their understanding of the definition of terms used in electrochemistry, and some of the understanding of physics of corrosion.\nMnemonics and definitions  OILRIG: Oxidation Is Loss Reduction Is Gain\n At an Anode we have oxidAtion\n At a Cathode we have reduCtion\n A reduction reaction has the electrons on the left.","tags":["corrosion","electrochemistry"],"title":"Corrosion Notes (May 2018)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524556800,"objectID":"ea09d10a7fdd98c31f48fb3fc79ab7e1","permalink":"/talk/computational-corrosion-tyc/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T17:41:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/computational-corrosion-tyc/","section":"talk","summary":"A kick-off meeting with the wider Thomas Young Centre groups.","tags":[],"title":"Computational Corrosion TYC","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Magnesium alloys are lightweight and strong, but technological applications are limited by high rates of aqueeous corrosion (even damp air is sufficient!).\nMagnesium can used for medical implants that are designed to dissolve over time, hence corrosion is desirable.

As a check on the correctness of the method we investigate a perfect atomic wire of Cu atoms and a perfect nonorthogonal chain of H atoms.  For both atom chains we find that the conductance has a value of exactly one quantum unit and that this is rather insensitive to the strength of coupling of the probes to the system, provided values of the coupling are of the same order as the mean interlevel spacing ofthe system without probes. For the Cu atom chain we find in addition that away from the regions with probes attached, the potential in the wire is uniform, while within them it follows a predicted exponential variation with position. We then apply the method to an initial investigation of the suitability of graphene as a contact material for molecular electronics. We perform calculations on a carbon nanoribbon to determine the correct coupling strength of the probes to the graphene and obtain a conductance of about two quantum units corresponding to two bands crossing the Fermi surface.  We then compute the current through a benzene molecule attached to two graphene contacts and find only a very weak current because of the disruption of the π conjugation by the covalent bond between the benzene and the graphene. In all cases we find that very strong or weak probe couplings suppress the current.","tags":[],"title":"HairyProbes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.Y. Lozovoi","D.L. Pashov","T.J.

This extends the model introduced in two previous papers from molecular and liquid applications into the solid state, thus completing the task of providing a comprehensive and unified scheme for studying chemical reactions, particularly aimed at problems in catalysis and electrochemistry. As before, experimental results are given priority over theoretical ones in selecting targets for model fitting, for which we used crystal parameters and band gaps of titania bulk polymorphs, rutile and anatase. The model is applied to six low index titania surfaces, with and without oxygen vacancies and adsorbed water molecules, both in dissociated and non-dissociated states.  Finally, we present the results of molecular dynamics simulation of an anatase cluster with a number of adsorbed water molecules and discuss the role of edge and corner atoms of the cluster.","tags":[],"title":"JCP III","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.Y.

The model is applied to water monomer, dimer, hexamers, ice, and liquid, where it demonstrates good agreement with theoretical results obtained by more accurate methods, such as DFT and CCSD(T), and with experiment. In particular, the temperature dependence of the self diffusion coefficient in liquid water predicted by the model, closely reproduces experimental curves in the temperature interval between 230 K and 350 K. In addition, and in contrast to standard DFT, the model properly orders the relative densities of liquid water and ice. A notable, but inevitable, shortcoming of the model is underestimation of the static dielectric constant by a factor of two. We demonstrate that the description of inter and intramolecular forces embodied in the tight binding approximation in quantum mechanics leads to a number of valuable insights which can be missing from ab initio quantum chemistry and classical force fields. These include a discussion of the origin of the enhanced molecular electric dipole moment in the condensed phases, and a detailed explanation for the increase of coordination number in liquid water as a function of temperature and compared with ice—leading to insights into the anomalous expansion on freezing. The theory holds out the prospect of an understanding of the currently unexplained density maximum of water near the freezing point.","tags":[],"title":"JCP II","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.J.

If the expansion is taken to second order then the energy and electron density matrix need to be calculated self consistently and from this functional one can derive a charge self consistent tight binding theory. In this paper we have used this to describe a polarizable ion tight binding model which has the benefit of treating charge transfer in point multipoles. This admits a ready description of ionic polarizability and crystal field splitting.  It is necessary in constructing such a model to find a number of parameters that mimic their more exact counterparts in the density functional theory. We describe in detail how this is done using a combination of intuition, exact analytical fitting, and a genetic optimization algorithm.  Having obtained model parameters we show that this constitutes a transferable scheme that can be applied rather universally to small and medium sized organic molecules. We have shown that the model gives a good account of static structural and dynamic vibrational properties of a library of molecules, and finally we demonstrate the model’s capability by showing a real time simulation of an enolization reaction in aqueous solution.  In two subsequent papers, we show that the model is a great deal more general in that it will describe solvents and solid substrates and that therefore we have created a self consistent quantum mechanical scheme that may be applied to simulations in heterogeneous catalysis.","tags":[],"title":"JCP I","type":"publication"}]
