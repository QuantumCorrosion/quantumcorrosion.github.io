      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magnesium alloys are lightweight and strong, but technological applications are
limited by high rates of aqueeous corrosion (even damp air is sufficient!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnesium can used for medical implants that are designed to dissolve over
time, hence corrosion is desirable.
However, the corrosion rate needs to be controlled to prevent damaging hydrogen
build up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Titanium alloys are relatively corrosion resistant, but in the aerospace sector
suffer stress corrosion cracking following degreasing in chlorine-containing
agents, or even after handling by salty fingers! When titanium is used for
medical implants, corrosion is a principal cause of failure; for example,
localised wear of an implant exposes a small area of metal establishing a large
anodic current density and localised metal wastage.&lt;/p&gt;
